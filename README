----------
Calculator
---------

A simple command line calculator, with the ability to solve simple linear equations.

--------------------------
Compiling and dependencies
--------------------------

Simply run `make` in the root of the project directory. The executable `calc` can be
found in the 'bin' subdirectory.

In order to run the test suite for the project, there are two dependencies:
1. CUunit (required)
2. Valgrind (optional)
CUnit is required for compilation and running of test suite. Valgrind is used for an
in-depth memory usage analysis.
The executable `suite` can be found in the 'test' subdirectory.
To run valgrind memory test with the test suite, you can:
1. make valgrind
2. run manually `valgrind ./test/suite` from the command line

Usage
-----

Calculator supports the following mathematical operators: multiplication, division,
addition, substraction and logarithm. It also supports parentheses.

Calculator works in two modes: simple calculation and linear equation solving.
Simple calculations take the form of an expression, while linear equations take the form
`expression` = `expression`.

Expressions used in linear equations can have variable `x` present - the application will
try to calculate the solution for the equation without an unknown variable, but there
are only two possibilities in that case: either all numbers satisfy that equation, or none
do.

Since this is a fairly simple equation solver, variable `x` is prohibited from taking
part in division and logarithm. These operations can appear in the linear equation, but
variable `x` must not take part in them, for example: 3x + 4/2 = 18.

If the application detects that the equation is not linear, it will repert error and
stop trying to solve it, for example: 4x * (x + 2) = 8/19.

Future improvements
-------------------

In order to make the calculator a more complete application, several improvements could
be made:

* Unary minus operator.
* More mathematical functions with [0..n] arguments.
* Higher order equation solver.
